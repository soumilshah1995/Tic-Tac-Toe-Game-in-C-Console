# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-in-C-Console

## Problem Statement: 
Design a Game Tic Tac Toe in c ++, Read the Input from A file 

### Approach 
#### Step 1:  Read the Input from File
* Convert the input to Character and store in Vector 
* Store the character of inputs in 2-D Vector

#### Step 2:
* Every Character that is Vector validate the inputs 
* check is input is X O or E and length is 9 anything else its not valid

#### Step 3: make Function winner 
* winner check for x wins or O wins
* winner function also check if no body wins is it a tie ?
* function check is game going on if yes it should suggest a Move 

# Challenges

* 	Had lot of difficulty in making logic for Validation
* 	Had issue how to convert Vector which has Empty space position how to choose random value from vector of empty spaces 
* 	Implementing Logic for if Game is Continue How to predict he Next Move 
* 	With Operator Overloading
